                                <p> If I told you that I had a neurological disease which meant
                                     that for eight or more hours a day I lost control of my faculties,
                                     bade farewell to the outside world, and was subject to complex hallucinations and delusions 
                                     – such as being chased by a grizzly bear at Stockport Railway Station 
                                     – you would think I was in a pretty bad way.

                                <p>Of course, sleep is not a disease at all, but the condition of daily (nightly) life for
                                     the vast majority of us.

                                <p>Since all animals sleep, we assume it has a biological purpose. 
                                    The trouble is, we don’t know what that purpose is. 
                                    There are many theories – energy conservation, growth promotion,
                                     immobilisation during hours of darkness when it might be dangerous
                                      to be out and about, consolidation of memories – but they are all open 
                                      to serious objections. 
                                </p>
                                <p>William Dement, one of the leading researchers 
                                      of the last century and co-discoverer of Rapid Eye Movement sleep,
                                       concluded from his fifty years in the forefront of the field that 
                                       “the only reason we need to sleep that is really, really solid,
                                        is that we get sleepy.”

                            <p class="award-p"> Not only is sleep a reminder of our ultimate helplessness, 
                                or even of how circumscribed a place thought sometimes plays in our lives, 
                                there is also the fear of contagion, as if talking about sleep might induce it – 
                                just as this reference to yawning will get at least 50% of you yawning 
                                in the next 15 minutes. <strong>(It’s a fact, honest!)</strong>
